# ESP-NOW_CNC_Pendant
Wireless pendant for CNC machines using the ESP-NOW protocol, by Prof. Steve M. Potter.

The code is not polished or optimized...Use at your own risk. 

Here is a video explaining the pendant and showing its functionality and performance:

I designed and programmed a wireless remote controller for my portable MPCNC carver. After nearly a year of hacking, coding, soldering, and learning, this pendant is now working very well. But it is still in the prototype stage, as there are some more bells and whistles to add. It uses Espressif's ESP-NOW wireless protocol, which is not WiFi or Bluetooth and does not need a router or internet connection.
